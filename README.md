<p>TS (TeamSport) Tracker is a front-end React application that displays the details of TeamSport Karting events. It uses TeamSport's API to list karting events including public and #GRID member events and provide details about each event including information that is not shown to the user but returned by the API such as the total number of people booked onto each event and max slots. This information can be useful when booking as a group or keeping track of the amount of people in a event.</p> 
<p>It was built using Vite.js, React and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS and Material Tailwind are used for styling and components.</p>
<p>TS Tracker provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Details about event including event title, time, slots and number of racers signed up (in real time)</li>
  <li>Share button that copies a URL that links directly to that event displaying information about it and a option to book</li>
  <li>Book button that leads directly to TeamSport's booking system and automatically adds that event to cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>More features are planned including adding all TeamSport venues, all go karting events and other useful features.</p>
