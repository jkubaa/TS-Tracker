<p>TS (TeamSport) Tracker is a front-end React application that displays the details of TeamSport Karting sessions. It uses TeamSport's API to list karting sessions including public and #GRID member sessions and provide details about each session including information that is not shown to the user but returned by the API such as the total number of people booked onto each session and max slots. This information can be useful when booking as a group or keeping track of the amount of people in a session.</p> 
<p>It was built using Vite.js and React TypeScript. Tailwind CSS and Material Tailwind are used for styling and components.</p>
<p>TS Tracker provides karting session information such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Session title</li>
  <li>Session time</li>
  <li>Session slots and number of racers signed up (in real time)</li>
  <li>Share button that copies a URL that links directly to that session displaying information about it and a option to book</li>
  <li>Book button that leads directly to TeamSport's booking system and automatically adds that session to cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>More features are planned including adding all TeamSport venues and the rest of the karting sessions.</p>
