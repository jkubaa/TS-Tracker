<h1>TeamSport (TS) Tracker</h1>
<p>Live website: <a href="https://tstracker.pages.dev/">https://tstracker.pages.dev/</a></p>
<p>TS Tracker is a front-end web application that uses TeamSport's API to list karting sessions including public and #GRID member sessions and provide information about each session including information that is not shown to the user but returned by the API such as the total number of people booked onto each session and max slots.</p> 
<p>This web app provides session information such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Session title</li>
  <li>Session time</li>
  <li>Session slots and number of racers signed up (in real time)</li>
  <li>Book button that leads directly to TeamSport's booking system and automatically adds that session to cart</li>
</ul>
<p>More features are planned including adding all TeamSport venues and the rest of the karting sessions.</p>
